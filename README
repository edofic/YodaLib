YodaLib version 0.2
===================

android library project with some reusable components

NOTE: taged versions SHOULD be backwards compatible(though i don't guarantee)

currently contains:
    - very simple database datasource with automatic code generation
        you only add some annotations to your class and you're ready to go
        
    - simple database
        you extend the Database class and put in some annotated datasource
        they can also be private and accesed through forwarding methods

    - managed locator. aggregates and filters location updates and notifies 
    	your handler
    	
	- asyncloader layout
	    extended relative layout to make loading content through AsyncTasks 
	    easier.


Feature requests/suggestions are appreciated, but pull requests are even better.
